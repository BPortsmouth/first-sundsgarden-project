        <h2>Pixel Art</h2>
        <p>Over the years, I've found different ways to use my creativity. One of my favourite creative outlets has been pixel art</p>
        <p>I wouldn't say I'm good by any means, but there are some things I've created that I'm proud of, like the image below and the icon for this page.</p>
        <img src="images/Lighthouse.png" width="384px" height="288px"
            alt="A pixel art image of a lighthouse. The image is in shades of blue to make it look like nighttime"
